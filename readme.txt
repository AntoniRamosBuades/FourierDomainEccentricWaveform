Once we have derived the expressions of e_t (eq. A.5 of the paper) using the 
files placed in the folder "et", we can use it to derive the expressions of the 
orbital phase phi (Eq. A7 of the paper) via the file "analytic_phi_2PN_et0_6.nb".

We can also derive the Fourier phase "Psi" (Eq. A3 of the paper) using "psi.nb".

Finally one can also derive the expression of time t(f) using "analytic_t_time_2PN_et_6.nb"
(not given in the paper) but given as Eq. 24 of another paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01341.pdf)
